# Django Blog Tutorial #

- This repository will follow a [django video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p)
by Corey Schafer.

- This video tutorial covered the basics of how to interact with the Django Admin app.

- Each branch that I will upload will be for a corresponding video (except for the first two as I mentioned above).

- Note the use of a virtual environment for the dependencies defined in the requirements.txt file.
